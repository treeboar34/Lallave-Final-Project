            <h2>Built by Gearheads</h2>
            <h2>for Gearheads.</h2>
            <p>Boosted is the brainchild of a group of passionate car enthusiasts who share a love for the open road, the thrill of the engine, and the camaraderie that comes with the automotive world.  We weren't satisfied with just another hostel stay â€“ we craved a place that truly understood the needs and desires of fellow petrolheads.  That's why we built Boosted Hostels, a haven where car lovers can connect, share experiences, and fuel their passion for all things automotive.</p>
